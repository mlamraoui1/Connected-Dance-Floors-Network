Part1:


In this part, we test only one sensor, the test is performed like this :

1- Connect the TR module to the evaluation board DK-EVAL-O4A and 
   connect to test Board DDC-SE-01 to the evaluation board, µ
   connect the sensor to the sensor board DDC-SE-01 
   by connecting the ports number 4 and numr 7 to the velostat sensor, 
   and then turn to the Potentiometer to the right until it stops turning.



2- For the software, open the project E00-START, 
   for the the TR module that will be installed on 
   the evaluation board DK-EVAL-04A implement the C file FOR_DK_EVAL, 
   and for the TR module that will be installed on the CK-USB 
   implement the file FOR_CK_MODULE. 
   You can watch the implementation process on one of the IQRF videos.


3- The results will be shown on the terminal Log, you will receive values of 2.9V
   if the sensor is not pressed, and if the sensor is pressed the value of the voltage 
   will drop, this way we can test our sensor if it is fully functionning.
